# mecab-packed

This is a Python packaged that will build and install Mecab and mecab-unidic.

The included Mecab source was downloaded from the [Mecab homepage](http://taku910.github.io/mecab/).

The included Unidic source was downloaded from the [Unidic homepage](https://ja.osdn.net/projects/unidic/). Something was off about the zip file, so it was unpacked and re-packaged as a `tar.gz` file, but otherwise unmodified.
